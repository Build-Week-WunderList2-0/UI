This is the way you take out your flustrations. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. We'll do another happy little painting.</P>

                    <P>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.</P>
